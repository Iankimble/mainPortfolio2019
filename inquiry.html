            <!--<b>Thank You ! You are Appreciated!</b>
            Thank you for interest in commissioning me for your project ! I hope to be able to assist in bringing your vision to reality
            at the highest degree of satisfaction and that this could potentially be the start of a successful and productive
            partnership.

            <b>The Purpose of This Brief: </b>
            This section was developed to help breakdown and assist clients in understanding the design process and project workflow,
            as well as to lightly outline project requirements and expectations.
            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 1: Mapping It Out: </b>
            Establishing a good work foundation is important to building something special. This stage of the process marks the first
            of a many conversations, particularly aimed at addressing both I and the client's initial questions, expectations
            and concerns as it relates to the project. Ultimately, my goal at this stage is to ascertain all the necessary
            information to effectively produce the clients work. Some of the areas of discussion include: Client/ creator
            requirements Project complexity and tangibility Timetable and deadlines Artwork usage and copyrights Payments
            and fees Project adjustments, postponements and cancellations Other relevant and necessary information related
            to the project work and project negotiations.
            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 2: Moving Forward with Confidence: </b> Trust and accountability
            are pertinent to a professional relationship. For the protection of myself and my clients I have created an agreement
            to ensure the highest quality client experience. After thoroughly discussing the project details, both parties
            (client and creator) will receive a copy of the project agreement; a document that transcribes many of the discussion
            points outlined in phase one. Before work can begin there are two requirements that must be satisfied. They are
            listed as followed: Both parties (client and creator) are required to sign the agreement. A down payment fee
            is required. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 3: Working Together: </b>
            To assure transparency and a seamless and satisfying client experience
            an open channel of communication is vital. I consider all projects to be collaborative works and during the production
            of the work, I aim obliged to answer any and all of my clients questions and or concerns regarding the status
            of the project. Naturally, there is an inherent expectation for the client to be engaged during the production
            of the work and be equally communicative as well. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Phase 4: The Fruit of Cooperation: </b> 
            The most satisfying part
            of this process for both parties is the completion. Through cooperation, both parties have come together to produce
            something truly special. I take great pride in producing a unique and satisfying product along with providing
            a fantastic service experience for my clients. At this phase, I encourage my clients to provide feedback on their
            experience with me, and if possible present suggestions to improve upon the service.
